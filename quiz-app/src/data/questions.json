    "question": "A 45-year-old woman with depression is about to start citalopram therapy. Pharmacogenomic testing reveals she is a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (*4/*4 genotype). What is the most appropriate clinical recommendation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Start at standard dose as CYP2D6 doesn't metabolize citalopram  ",
      "B": "Start at increased dose due to reduced drug activation  ",
      "C": "Switch to an alternative SSRI metabolized by different pathways  ",
      "D": "Start at reduced dose due to increased drug exposure"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Citalopram is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, not CYP2D6. Therefore, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status doesn't significantly affect citalopram dosing. This is a common board exam trap - knowing which drugs are metabolized by which enzymes is crucial for proper pharmacogenomic counseling.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "TPMT intermediate metabolizers (*1/*3A, *1/*3C) have reduced enzyme activity and require 30-70% dose reduction to avoid severe myelosuppression.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Using Hardy-Weinberg: If disease frequency (q²) = 1/2500, then q = 1/50. Since p + q = 1, p ≈ 49/50. Carrier frequency = 2pq = 2 × (49/50) × (1/50) ≈ 2/50 = 1/25. This calculation is fundamental for genetic counseling risk assessment and commonly tested on boards.",
