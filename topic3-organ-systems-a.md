## 🫁 PULMONARY DISORDERS

### Cystic Fibrosis (CF) ⭐⭐⭐
**Most Important Pulmonary Genetic Disorder - Study This First!**

#### 🔑 Key Features (Top 3)
1. **Pulmonary insufficiency** - chronic respiratory infections, thick mucus
2. **CBAVD** - congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (male infertility)
3. **Elevated sweat chloride** - diagnostic hallmark (>60 mEq/L)

#### 🏥 Clinical Features

**Pulmonary:**
- Thick, sticky mucus → chronic bacterial infections
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization
- Progressive lung damage and fibrosis
- Chronic cough, wheezing, shortness of breath

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Pancreatic insufficiency → malabsorption, FTT
- Meconium ileus (10-15% of newborns)
- CF-related diabetes (CFRD)
- Liver disease, gallstones

**Reproductive:**
- Male infertility due to CBAVD (>95%)
- Female fertility reduced but possible

**Other:**
- Salt-wasting, dehydration
- Nasal polyps, sinusitis
- Clubbing of fingers/toes

#### 🧬 CFTR Mutation Classes

**Class 1 - Protein Production Defects:**
- Nonsense, frameshift, splice mutations
- No functional CFTR produced
- **Severe phenotype**

**Class 2 - Protein Processing Defects:**
- ΔF508 (most common worldwide mutation)
- Protein misfolded, degraded before reaching membrane
- **Severe phenotype**

**Class 3 - Gating Defects:**
- G551D (responds to ivacaftor)
- Protein reaches membrane but doesn't open properly
- **Severe phenotype**

**Class 4 - Conduction Defects:**
- R117H (with poly T tract)
- Reduced chloride conductance
- **Milder phenotype**

**Class 5 - Insufficient Protein:**
- Splice mutations affecting protein amount
- **Variable phenotype**

**Class 6 - Decreased Stability:**
- Protein reaches membrane but unstable
- **Variable phenotype**

#### 🧪 CFTR Modifiers - R117H and Poly T Tract

**Critical Board Concept:**
- **R117H variant** + poly T tract = variable penetrance
- **Poly T tract**: 5T, 7T, or 9T repeats
- **TG tract**: Adjacent sequence affecting splicing

**Clinical Implications:**
- **R117H + 5T**: Pancreatic sufficient CF, CBAVD
- **R117H + 7T**: Variable phenotype
- **R117H + 9T**: Mild or asymptomatic
- **5T alone** (without R117H): Can cause CBAVD

#### 📊 Carrier Screening Guidelines

**ACOG Recommendations:**
- **Offer to all women** considering pregnancy or currently pregnant
- **Pan-ethnic screening** recommended
- **23-mutation panel** minimum (population-specific)
- **Extended panels** available but not required for screening

**Indications for Screening:**
- Family history of CF
- Ultrasound findings: echogenic bowel, dilated bowel
- Partner with CF or CBAVD
- Consanguinity

**Important Screening Notes:**
- **Full CFTR sequencing NOT recommended** for routine screening
- **R117H requires poly T testing** when detected
- **Population-specific residual risks** vary significantly

#### 🧪 Diagnostic Testing

**Gold Standard:**
- **Sweat chloride test**: >60 mEq/L diagnostic
- **Intermediate**: 30-59 mEq/L (repeat testing needed)
- **Normal**: <30 mEq/L

**Molecular Testing:**
- Confirm CFTR mutations
- Guide therapy selection (e.g., ivacaftor for G551D)

**Newborn Screening:**
- Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)
- DNA analysis if elevated IRT

#### 📈 Inheritance & Statistics
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal recessive
- **Prevalence**: 1/3,200 (varies by ethnicity)
- **Carrier frequency**: ~1/25 in Northern European populations
- **Mechanism**: Defective CFTR → abnormal chloride transport → thick mucus

#### 💎 Board Pearls
- CF is most common lethal AR disorder in Caucasians
- CFTR classes 1-3 = severe, classes 4-6 = milder
- ΔF508 accounts for ~70% of CF alleles worldwide
- CBAVD can be isolated (mild CFTR variants) or part of CF spectrum

## 🎯 Practice Questions

### Question 1
A couple undergoes CF carrier screening. The woman tests positive for ΔF508, and the man tests positive for R117H. Additional testing shows the man has R117H with 5T. What is the most likely phenotype if they have an affected child?

**A)** Classic cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency  
**B)** Pancreatic sufficient CF with mild lung disease  
**C)** Isolated CBAVD  
**D)** Normal phenotype

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Pancreatic sufficient CF with mild lung disease**

R117H with 5T typically causes pancreatic sufficient CF. When combined with a severe mutation like ΔF508, the phenotype is determined by the milder allele, resulting in pancreatic sufficient CF with variable lung involvement.
</details>

### Question 2
A 16-year-old competitive swimmer experiences recurrent syncope during practice. ECG shows QTc of 480 ms. Family history reveals a maternal uncle who died suddenly while swimming at age 20. What is the most likely genetic finding?

**A)** KCNQ1 mutation (LQT1)  
**B)** KCNH2 mutation (LQT2)  
**C)** SCN5A mutation (LQT3)  
**D)** RYR2 mutation (CPVT)

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) KCNQ1 mutation (LQT1)**

The combination of syncope with swimming (exercise trigger), prolonged QT interval, and family history of sudden death while swimming is highly suggestive of LQT1 (KCNQ1 mutations), which characteristically causes symptoms during exercise, especially swimming.
</details>

### Question 3
A 35-year-old man with emphysema has a ZZ genotype for α1-antitrypsin deficiency. His sister wants to know her risk. She has never smoked and is asymptomatic. What is her most likely genotype and recommendation?

**A)** ZZ genotype; she will definitely develop lung disease  
**B)** MZ genotype; no increased risk  
**C)** SZ or ZZ genotype; genetic testing recommended  
**D)** MM genotype; reassurance only

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) SZ or ZZ genotype; genetic testing recommended**

Since her brother has ZZ genotype, both parents are at least MZ carriers. Her possible genotypes are MM, MZ, SZ, or ZZ. Given the significant health implications and available interventions (smoking cessation, monitoring), genetic testing is appropriate to determine her exact risk.
</details>
