## 📚 Section 1: Trinucleotide Repeat Disorders

### Overview
Trinucleotide repeat disorders involve unstable expansions of DNA repeats that tend to increase in size when transmitted to offspring, leading to anticipation (earlier onset and increased severity in successive generations).

### 1.1 Huntington Disease (HD)

**Key Features:**
- **Classic Triad:** Chorea + Progressive motor disability + Cognitive decline
- **Additional Features:** Behavioral changes (irritability, depression), dysarthria, dysphagia
- **Age of Onset:** Typically 30-50 years (juvenile onset <20 years with paternal transmission)

**Genetics:**
- **Gene:** HTT (chromosome 4p16.3)
- **Repeat:** CAG in exon 1
- **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
- **Repeat Thresholds:**
  - Normal: <26 CAG repeats
  - Intermediate: 27-35 repeats (not affected, but unstable)
  - Reduced penetrance: 36-39 repeats
  - Full penetrance: ≥40 repeats
  - Juvenile onset: >60 repeats (usually paternal transmission)

**Testing Considerations:**
- Pre-symptomatic testing requires extensive counseling
- Consider psychological evaluation before testing
- Insurance and employment discrimination concerns
- Testing minors is generally not recommended

**Board Pearl:** 
> Paternal transmission more likely to result in expansion and juvenile onset due to instability during spermatogenesis

### 1.2 Fragile X Syndrome

- **Facial Features:** Long face, prominent ears, prominent jaw

**Genetics:**
- **Gene:** FMR1 (Xq27.3)
- **Repeat:** CGG in 5' UTR
- **Inheritance:** X-linked dominant with reduced penetrance

  - Normal: 5-44 CGG repeats
  - Intermediate: 45-54 repeats

  - >100 repeats: ~100% risk

**Testing Strategy:**

  - 20% duplications
  - 20% point mutations
- **De novo rate:** ~1/3 of cases
- **Reading Frame Rule:**

## 🎯 Board-Style Practice Questions

### Question 1
A 35-year-old man presents with progressive chorea and cognitive decline. His father died at age 45 with similar symptoms. Genetic testing reveals 42 CAG repeats in the HTT gene. His 25-year-old sister is considering predictive testing. What is the most important consideration?

A) She has a 25% chance of inheriting the expansion
B) Insurance discrimination is not a concern with GINA protection
C) Psychological counseling should be provided before and after testing
D) Testing should be delayed until she develops symptoms

**Answer: C**
*Explanation:* Pre-symptomatic testing for Huntington disease requires extensive genetic counseling and psychological support. While GINA provides some protection, it doesn't cover life or disability insurance. The sister has a 50% risk (not 25%). Testing asymptomatic individuals requires careful consideration of psychological readiness.

### Question 2
A couple's first child has spinal muscular atrophy type I with 2 copies of SMN2. Both parents are confirmed carriers. What is the recurrence risk and likely prognosis for future affected children?

A) 25% risk; variable severity depending on SMN2 copies
B) 50% risk; all affected will have type I SMA
C) 25% risk; severity correlates with SMN1 deletion size
D) <1% risk due to de novo mutations

**Answer: A**
*Explanation:* SMA is autosomal recessive with 25% recurrence risk. Severity correlates with SMN2 copy number (not SMN1 deletion size). While this child has type I, future affected children could have different SMN2 copy numbers and thus different severity.

### Question 3
A 2-year-old girl presents with loss of purposeful hand movements and repetitive hand-wringing after normal early development. Which test is most appropriate?

A) Chromosomal microarray
B) MECP2 sequencing
C) Metabolic screening
D) SMN1 deletion analysis

**Answer: B**
*Explanation:* This presentation is classic for Rett syndrome. Regression after normal development with stereotypic hand movements strongly suggests MECP2 mutation. While CMA might be considered for ID evaluation, the specific phenotype directs testing.

### Question 4
A woman with a family history of Fragile X syndrome is found to have 75 CGG repeats. What is her approximate risk of expansion to full mutation in offspring?

A) 3.7%
B) 31.1%
C) 80.1%
D) 100%

**Answer: B**
*Explanation:* Risk of expansion correlates with premutation size. For 70-79 repeats, the risk is approximately 31.1%. This risk increases with larger premutations, reaching near 100% for repeats >100.

### Question 5
A newborn boy has severe hypotonia, respiratory distress, and club feet. His mother has mild grip myotonia. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Congenital myotonic dystrophy
B) Spinal muscular atrophy type 0
C) Prader-Willi syndrome
D) Duchenne muscular dystrophy

**Answer: A**
*Explanation:* Congenital DM1 presents with severe hypotonia, respiratory issues, and club feet. Maternal transmission is almost universal for congenital form. Mother's mild myotonia suggests she has DM1 with smaller expansion.

### Question 6
A couple's first pregnancy was affected with anencephaly. What folic acid supplementation is recommended for the next pregnancy?

A) 400 μg daily starting at conception
B) 400 μg daily starting 3 months pre-conception
C) 4 mg daily starting at conception
D) 4 mg daily starting 3 months pre-conception

**Answer: D**
*Explanation:* After a previous NTD, high-dose folic acid (4 mg) is recommended starting 3 months before conception and continuing through the first trimester. This reduces recurrence risk from 2-3% to approximately 1%.

### Question 7
A 10-year-old boy with intellectual disability and autism has a head circumference >97th percentile. Which genetic test should be prioritized?

A) Fragile X testing
B) PTEN sequencing
C) Chromosomal microarray
D) MECP2 duplication testing

**Answer: B**
*Explanation:* Macrocephaly with ASD/ID strongly suggests PTEN mutation. While CMA is reasonable first-tier testing, the specific finding of macrocephaly directs testing toward PTEN-related disorders.

### Question 8
A male infant has pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, and cryptorchidism. His mother has similar facial features and short stature. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Turner syndrome
B) Noonan syndrome
C) DiGeorge syndrome
D) Williams syndrome

**Answer: B**
*Explanation:* Noonan syndrome features include pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, cryptorchidism, and distinctive facial features. Autosomal dominant inheritance explains affected mother. Turner syndrome only affects females.

### Question 9
In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which finding indicates carrier status in the mother?

A) Elevated CK levels
B) Calf pseudohypertrophy
C) Molecular confirmation of heterozygous mutation
D) Positive Gower sign

**Answer: C**
*Explanation:* Molecular testing is required for reliable carrier detection in DMD. CK levels are unreliable in carriers. Clinical findings are rare in carriers due to favorable X-inactivation.

### Question 10
A 4-year-old boy has progressive proximal muscle weakness with preserved reflexes and normal intelligence. CK is 12,000. What is the best initial test?

A) DMD deletion/duplication analysis
B) SMN1 deletion analysis
C) Muscle biopsy
D) Nerve conduction studies

**Answer: A**
*Explanation:* Very high CK with proximal weakness suggests muscular dystrophy. DMD deletion/duplication analysis detects 80% of mutations. This should be performed before invasive muscle biopsy. Normal reflexes argue against SMA.
