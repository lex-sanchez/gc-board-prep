## üìö Core Practice Questions by Topic

## Topic 1: Chromosomal Disorders

### Question 1.1
A 25-year-old pregnant woman has a fetus with the following ultrasound findings: choroid plexus cysts, clenched fists, and IUGR. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Trisomy 13  
**B)** Trisomy 18  
**C)** Trisomy 21  
**D)** Turner syndrome

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Trisomy 18**

The classic triad of choroid plexus cysts, clenched fists, and IUGR is pathognomonic for trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome). These findings together have high specificity for this condition.
</details>

### Question 1.2
Which serum screening pattern is most consistent with Down syndrome?

**A)** ‚ÜëhCG, ‚ÜìPAPP-A, ‚ÜìAFP, ‚ÜìuE3  
**B)** ‚ÜìhCG, ‚ÜìPAPP-A, ‚ÜìAFP, ‚ÜìuE3  
**C)** ‚ÜëhCG, ‚Üëinhibin, ‚ÜìPAPP-A, ‚ÜìAFP, ‚ÜìuE3  
**D)** ‚ÜìhCG, ‚Üëinhibin, ‚ÜëPAPP-A, ‚ÜëAFP

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) ‚ÜëhCG, ‚Üëinhibin, ‚ÜìPAPP-A, ‚ÜìAFP, ‚ÜìuE3**

Down syndrome shows elevated hCG and inhibin A, with decreased levels of PAPP-A, AFP, and uE3. This pattern is distinct from trisomies 18 and 13, which show decreased levels across all markers.
</details>

### Question 1.3
A newborn presents with hypocalcemia, conotruncal heart defect, and absent thymus on chest X-ray. What is the most appropriate next step?

**A)** Karyotype  
**B)** Chromosomal microarray  
**C)** FISH for 22q11.2  
**D)** Fragile X testing

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) FISH for 22q11.2**

The clinical presentation (hypocalcemia, conotruncal heart defect, absent thymus) is pathognomonic for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome). While CMA provides comprehensive analysis, FISH for 22q11.2 remains a rapid, targeted test when clinical suspicion is high for this specific syndrome.
</details>

---

## Topic 2: Cancer Genetics

### Question 2.1
A 35-year-old woman with breast cancer has a family history of ovarian cancer in her mother and pancreatic cancer in her maternal grandfather. Genetic testing is most likely to reveal a mutation in which gene?

**A)** BRCA1  
**B)** BRCA2  
**C)** TP53  
**D)** PALB2

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) BRCA2**

The combination of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer in the same family lineage is most suggestive of BRCA2. While BRCA1 is associated with breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA2 has a stronger association with pancreatic cancer (3-5% lifetime risk) and male breast cancer.
</details>

### Question 2.2
A 25-year-old man presents with bilateral vestibular schwannomas and cataracts. His father had similar symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Neurofibromatosis type 1  
**B)** Neurofibromatosis type 2  
**C)** Tuberous sclerosis complex  
**D)** von Hippel-Lindau syndrome

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Neurofibromatosis type 2**

Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are pathognomonic for NF2. The presence of cataracts (cortical wedge type) further supports this diagnosis. NF1 rarely causes bilateral vestibular schwannomas.
</details>

### Question 2.3
A family meets Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome. Tumor testing on the proband's colon cancer shows MSI-high and loss of MLH1 by immunohistochemistry. What is the next most appropriate step?

**A)** MLH1 germline sequencing  
**B)** BRAF V600E testing on tumor  
**C)** MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing  
**D)** Germline testing of all Lynch genes

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing**

When a tumor shows loss of MLH1 by IHC, the next step is to determine if this is due to somatic hypermethylation (sporadic) or germline mutation (Lynch syndrome). MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing should be performed first. If negative, then germline testing is indicated. If hypermethylation is positive, BRAF V600E testing may confirm sporadic origin.
</details>

## Topic 3: Organ Systems A

### Question 3.1
A couple undergoes CF carrier screening. The woman tests positive for ŒîF508, and the man tests positive for R117H. Additional testing shows the man has R117H with 5T. What is the most likely phenotype if they have an affected child?

**A)** Classic cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency  
**B)** Pancreatic sufficient CF with mild lung disease  
**C)** Isolated CBAVD  
**D)** Normal phenotype

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Pancreatic sufficient CF with mild lung disease**

R117H with 5T typically causes pancreatic sufficient CF. When combined with a severe mutation like ŒîF508, the phenotype is determined by the milder allele, resulting in pancreatic sufficient CF with variable lung involvement.
</details>

### Question 3.2
A 16-year-old competitive swimmer experiences recurrent syncope during practice. ECG shows QTc of 480 ms. Family history reveals a maternal uncle who died suddenly while swimming at age 20. What is the most likely genetic finding?

**A)** KCNQ1 mutation (LQT1)  
**B)** KCNH2 mutation (LQT2)  
**C)** SCN5A mutation (LQT3)  
**D)** RYR2 mutation (CPVT)

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) KCNQ1 mutation (LQT1)**

The combination of syncope with swimming (exercise trigger), prolonged QT interval, and family history of sudden death while swimming is highly suggestive of LQT1 (KCNQ1 mutations), which characteristically causes symptoms during exercise, especially swimming.
</details>

### Question 3.3
A 35-year-old man with emphysema has a ZZ genotype for Œ±1-antitrypsin deficiency. His sister wants to know her risk. She has never smoked and is asymptomatic. What is her most likely genotype and recommendation?

**A)** ZZ genotype; she will definitely develop lung disease  
**B)** MZ genotype; no increased risk  
**C)** SZ or ZZ genotype; genetic testing recommended  
**D)** MM genotype; reassurance only

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) SZ or ZZ genotype; genetic testing recommended**

Since her brother has ZZ genotype, both parents are at least MZ carriers. Her possible genotypes are MM, MZ, SZ, or ZZ. Given the significant health implications and available interventions (smoking cessation, monitoring), genetic testing is appropriate to determine her exact risk.
</details>

## Topic 4: Neurological & Developmental

### Question 4.1
A 35-year-old man presents with progressive chorea and cognitive decline. His father died at age 45 with similar symptoms. Genetic testing reveals 42 CAG repeats in the HTT gene. His 25-year-old sister is considering predictive testing. What is the most important consideration?

**A)** She has a 25% chance of inheriting the expansion  
**B)** Insurance discrimination is not a concern with GINA protection  
**C)** Psychological counseling should be provided before and after testing  
**D)** Testing should be delayed until she develops symptoms

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Psychological counseling should be provided before and after testing**

Pre-symptomatic testing for Huntington disease requires extensive genetic counseling and psychological support. IMPORTANT: GINA does NOT protect against discrimination in life, disability, or long-term care insurance. The sister has a 50% risk (not 25%). Testing asymptomatic individuals requires careful consideration of psychological readiness.
</details>

### Question 4.2
A couple's first child has spinal muscular atrophy type I with 2 copies of SMN2. Both parents are confirmed carriers. What is the recurrence risk and likely prognosis for future affected children?

**A)** 25% risk; variable severity depending on SMN2 copies  
**B)** 50% risk; all affected will have type I SMA  
**C)** 25% risk; severity correlates with SMN1 deletion size  
**D)** <1% risk due to de novo mutations

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) 25% risk; variable severity depending on SMN2 copies**

SMA is autosomal recessive with 25% recurrence risk. Severity correlates with SMN2 copy number (not SMN1 deletion size). While this child has type I, future affected children could have different SMN2 copy numbers and thus different severity.
</details>

### Question 4.3
A 2-year-old girl presents with loss of purposeful hand movements and repetitive hand-wringing after normal early development. Which test is most appropriate?

**A)** Chromosomal microarray  
**B)** MECP2 sequencing  
**C)** Metabolic screening  
**D)** SMN1 deletion analysis

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) MECP2 sequencing**

This presentation is classic for Rett syndrome. Regression after normal development with stereotypic hand movements strongly suggests MECP2 mutation. While CMA might be considered for ID evaluation, the specific phenotype directs testing.
</details>

### Question 4.4
A woman with a family history of Fragile X syndrome is found to have 75 CGG repeats. What is her approximate risk of expansion to full mutation in offspring?

**A)** 3.7%  
**B)** 31.1%  
**C)** 80.1%  
**D)** 100%

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) 31.1%**

Risk of expansion correlates with premutation size. For 70-79 repeats, the risk is approximately 31.1% (these are empiric risks that may vary). This risk increases with larger premutations, reaching near 100% for repeats >100.
</details>

### Question 4.5
A newborn boy has severe hypotonia, respiratory distress, and club feet. His mother has mild grip myotonia. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Congenital myotonic dystrophy  
**B)** Spinal muscular atrophy type 0  
**C)** Prader-Willi syndrome  
**D)** Duchenne muscular dystrophy

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) Congenital myotonic dystrophy**

Congenital DM1 presents with severe hypotonia, respiratory issues, and club feet. Maternal transmission is almost universal for congenital form. Mother's mild myotonia suggests she has DM1 with smaller expansion.
</details>

### Question 4.6
A couple's first pregnancy was affected with anencephaly. What folic acid supplementation is recommended for the next pregnancy?

**A)** 400 Œºg daily starting at conception  
**B)** 400 Œºg daily starting 3 months pre-conception  
**C)** 4 mg daily starting at conception  
**D)** 4 mg daily starting 3 months pre-conception

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: D) 4 mg daily starting 3 months pre-conception**

After a previous NTD, high-dose folic acid (4 mg) is recommended starting 3 months before conception and continuing through the first trimester. This reduces recurrence risk from 2-3% to approximately 1%.
</details>

### Question 4.7
A 10-year-old boy with intellectual disability and autism has a head circumference >97th percentile. Which genetic test should be prioritized?

**A)** Fragile X testing  
**B)** PTEN sequencing  
**C)** Chromosomal microarray  
**D)** MECP2 duplication testing

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) PTEN sequencing**

Macrocephaly with ASD/ID strongly suggests PTEN mutation. While CMA is reasonable first-tier testing, the specific finding of macrocephaly directs testing toward PTEN-related disorders.
</details>

### Question 4.8
A male infant has pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, and cryptorchidism. His mother has similar facial features and short stature. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Turner syndrome  
**B)** Noonan syndrome  
**C)** DiGeorge syndrome  
**D)** Williams syndrome

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Noonan syndrome**

Noonan syndrome features include pulmonary valve stenosis, short stature, cryptorchidism, and distinctive facial features. Autosomal dominant inheritance explains affected mother. Turner syndrome only affects females.
</details>

### Question 4.9
In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which finding indicates carrier status in the mother?

**A)** Elevated CK levels  
**B)** Calf pseudohypertrophy  
**C)** Molecular confirmation of heterozygous mutation  
**D)** Positive Gower sign

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Molecular confirmation of heterozygous mutation**

Molecular testing is required for reliable carrier detection in DMD. CK levels are unreliable in carriers. Clinical findings are rare in carriers due to favorable X-inactivation.
</details>

### Question 4.10
A 4-year-old boy has progressive proximal muscle weakness with preserved reflexes and normal intelligence. CK is 12,000. What is the best initial test?

**A)** DMD deletion/duplication analysis  
**B)** SMN1 deletion analysis  
**C)** Muscle biopsy  
**D)** Nerve conduction studies

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) DMD deletion/duplication analysis**

Very high CK with proximal weakness suggests muscular dystrophy. DMD deletion/duplication analysis detects 80% of mutations. This should be performed before invasive muscle biopsy. Normal reflexes argue against SMA.
</details>

## Topic 5: Metabolic Disorders

### Question 5.1
A 6-month-old presents with poor feeding, vomiting, and lethargy after a viral illness. Labs show hypoglycemia without ketones, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperammonemia. Acylcarnitine profile shows elevated C8. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** MCAD deficiency  
**B)** Propionic acidemia  
**C)** Glycogen storage disease I  
**D)** Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) MCAD deficiency**

- Hypoketotic hypoglycemia is classic
- C8 elevation specific for MCAD
- Triggered by illness/fasting
- Hyperammonemia can occur
</details>

### Question 5.2
A couple of Ashkenazi Jewish descent requests carrier screening. The woman is found to be a carrier for Gaucher disease. What is the chance their child will be affected if the man is also of 100% Ashkenazi Jewish descent?

**A)** 1:60  
**B)** 1:120  
**C)** 1:240  
**D)** 1:900

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) 1:60**

- Woman is carrier (confirmed)
- Man's carrier risk: 1:15 (AJ population - some sources cite 1:18)
- Risk calculation: 1 √ó 1/15 √ó 1/4 = 1/60
</details>

### Question 5.3
A 2-year-old boy presents with coarse facial features, developmental delay, and chronic ear infections. Physical exam reveals hepatosplenomegaly and limited joint mobility. Urine GAGs show increased heparan and dermatan sulfate. His maternal uncle died at age 8 with similar features. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** MPS I (Hurler syndrome)  
**B)** MPS II (Hunter syndrome)  
**C)** MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome)  
**D)** Gaucher disease

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) MPS II (Hunter syndrome)**

- X-linked inheritance (affected maternal uncle)
- Both heparan and dermatan sulfate elevated
- Early death common in severe form
- Hunter = Hereditary (X-linked)
</details>

### Question 5.4
A newborn screening result shows extremely elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The baby appears well. What is the most likely diagnosis and immediate concern?

**A)** CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; salt-wasting crisis  
**B)** CAH due to 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency; hypertension  
**C)** 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency; virilization  
**D)** False positive; preterm birth

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; salt-wasting crisis**

- 17-OHP most specific for 21-hydroxylase deficiency
- Most common form (95%) of CAH
- Salt-wasting can be life-threatening
- Immediate evaluation needed even if asymptomatic
</details>

### Question 5.5
A 3-year-old girl with developmental delay has been on a low-protein diet since birth. Her blood phenylalanine level on diet is 4 mg/dL. Her mother is planning another pregnancy. What is the most important counseling point?

**A)** The recurrence risk is 25%  
**B)** Prenatal diagnosis is available  
**C)** Mother needs strict dietary control before conception  
**D)** The child can liberalize her diet as she gets older

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Mother needs strict dietary control before conception**

- This describes a child with PKU whose mother is planning another pregnancy
- The mother herself has PKU and risks maternal PKU syndrome
- Mother must achieve phenylalanine <6 mg/dL before conception and maintain throughout pregnancy
- Prevents fetal damage (microcephaly, heart defects, IUGR)
</details>

## Topic 6: Specialized Systems

### Question 6.1
A couple of Mediterranean ancestry requests carrier screening. The woman's CBC shows: Hgb 11.5 g/dL, MCV 72 fL. The man's CBC is normal. What is the most appropriate next step?

**A)** Reassure that only one partner needs testing  
**B)** Order hemoglobin electrophoresis on the woman  
**C)** Order molecular testing for Œ≤-thalassemia  
**D)** Recommend prenatal diagnosis

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Order hemoglobin electrophoresis on the woman**

- Low MCV suggests possible thalassemia trait
- Hemoglobin electrophoresis can identify Œ≤-thalassemia trait (elevated Hb A2)
- Partner testing depends on woman's results
</details>

### Question 6.2
A pregnant woman is a carrier for hemophilia A. Her partner is unaffected. CVS shows a 46,XY karyotype. What is the risk the fetus is affected?

**A)** 0%  
**B)** 25%  
**C)** 50%  
**D)** 100%

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) 50%**

- X-linked recessive inheritance
- Male fetus has 50% chance of inheriting mutation
- Would be affected if inherits mutation
</details>

### Question 6.3

**A)** <1%  
**B)** 25%  
**C)** 50%  
**D)** 67%

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) <1%**

- OI type II usually due to de novo dominant mutations
- Empiric recurrence risk is ~1-2% due to possibility of gonadal mosaicism (could be as high as 5-7% if present)
- Prenatal diagnosis recommended for reassurance
</details>

### Question 6.4
A 6-month-old girl presents with blistering along linear patterns on her trunk. Her mother had similar lesions as an infant that resolved. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Epidermolysis bullosa  
**B)** Incontinentia pigmenti  
**C)** Bloom syndrome  
**D)** Xeroderma pigmentosum

<details>

## üß† Advanced Practice Questions by Domain

> **üìù Advanced Study Tip**: These questions require integration of multiple concepts and reflect emerging areas of genetic counseling practice. They are designed for students who have mastered basic concepts and target underrepresented board exam topics.

## Pharmacogenomics

### Question 7.1
A 45-year-old woman with depression is about to start citalopram therapy. Pharmacogenomic testing reveals she is a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (*4/*4 genotype). What is the most appropriate clinical recommendation?

**A)** Start at standard dose as CYP2D6 doesn't metabolize citalopram  
**B)** Start at increased dose due to reduced drug activation  
**C)** Switch to an alternative SSRI metabolized by different pathways  
**D)** Start at reduced dose due to increased drug exposure

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) Start at standard dose as CYP2D6 doesn't metabolize citalopram**

Citalopram is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, not CYP2D6. Therefore, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status doesn't significantly affect citalopram dosing. This is a common board exam trap - knowing which drugs are metabolized by which enzymes is crucial for proper pharmacogenomic counseling.
</details>

### Question 7.2
A 6-year-old with acute lymphoblastic leukemia requires 6-mercaptopurine therapy. TPMT genotyping shows *1/*3A (intermediate metabolizer). What dosing adjustment is recommended?

**A)** No change needed  
**B)** Reduce dose to 50-70% of standard  
**C)** Reduce dose to 10% of standard  
**D)** Increase dose by 50%

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Reduce dose to 50-70% of standard**

TPMT intermediate metabolizers (*1/*3A, *1/*3C) have reduced enzyme activity and require 30-70% dose reduction to avoid severe myelosuppression. Homozygous variants (*3A/*3A) require 90% reduction or alternative therapy. This directly impacts patient safety and is high-yield for boards.
</details>

---

## Population Genetics

### Question 8.1
In a population where the frequency of cystic fibrosis is 1 in 2,500, what is the carrier frequency? Assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

**A)** 1 in 25  
**B)** 1 in 50  
**C)** 1 in 100  
**D)** 1 in 250

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: A) 1 in 25**

Using Hardy-Weinberg: If disease frequency (q¬≤) = 1/2500, then q = 1/50. Since p + q = 1, p ‚âà 49/50. Carrier frequency = 2pq = 2 √ó (49/50) √ó (1/50) ‚âà 2/50 = 1/25. This calculation is fundamental for genetic counseling risk assessment and commonly tested on boards.
</details>

### Question 8.2
A couple from a Finnish population isolate seeks counseling. The woman carries a mutation causing congenital nephrosis (1 in 8 carrier frequency in their population vs. 1 in 200 worldwide). This increased frequency is best explained by:

**A)** Heterozygote advantage  
**B)** Founder effect  
**C)** Consanguinity  
**D)** New mutation rate

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Founder effect**

The dramatically increased carrier frequency in an isolated population is characteristic of founder effect. Finnish populations have multiple founder mutations due to historical population bottlenecks. This concept is crucial for understanding population-specific genetic risks and counseling patients from isolated populations.
</details>

## Ethical Scenarios

### Question 9.1
A 16-year-old requests predictive testing for familial ALS caused by a C9orf72 expansion. Her affected mother is still living but doesn't want to know her own genetic status. The counselor should:

**A)** Proceed with testing as the teen has autonomy  
**B)** Refuse testing until she turns 18  
**C)** Test only if the mother consents  
**D)** Explore the teen's understanding and involve appropriate stakeholders

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: D) Explore the teen's understanding and involve appropriate stakeholders**

Testing minors for adult-onset conditions requires careful consideration. The counselor should assess the teen's maturity, understanding of implications, reasons for testing, and potential family impacts. This may involve ethics consultation and family counseling. Simply refusing or proceeding without careful evaluation would be inappropriate.
</details>

### Question 9.2
During cancer genetic counseling, a patient reveals her BRCA2 mutation but forbids you from informing her sister, who is also your patient. You should:

**A)** Immediately inform the sister due to duty to warn  
**B)** Respect confidentiality and document the discussion  
**C)** Refuse to continue counseling either patient  
**D)** Report to the medical board for guidance

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Respect confidentiality and document the discussion**

Genetic counselors must maintain confidentiality. While encouraging family communication, there is no legal "duty to warn" for genetic information in most jurisdictions. Document attempts to facilitate family communication and provide resources for the patient to share information when ready.
</details>

## Prenatal Genetics

### Question 10.1
A 38-year-old woman presents at 11 weeks gestation. Her integrated screening shows: NT 3.5mm, PAPP-A 0.3 MoM, hCG 2.1 MoM. Her adjusted risk for Down syndrome is 1:50. She is highly anxious and wants "definitive" results. The BEST next step is:

**A)** Immediate CVS for rapid karyotype  
**B)** Cell-free DNA screening  
**C)** Detailed counseling about all options including their limitations  
**D)** Reassurance that most pregnancies with these markers are normal

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Detailed counseling about all options including their limitations**

The counselor must provide comprehensive, non-directive counseling about all options. This includes discussing cfDNA (high sensitivity but still screening), diagnostic testing (CVS/amnio with small miscarriage risk), and expectant management. Understanding patient values and providing accurate information supersedes pushing any single option.
</details>

### Question 10.2
A couple presents for counseling after their 20-week ultrasound showed bilateral renal agenesis. Which counseling approach is MOST appropriate?

**A)** Focus immediately on pregnancy termination options  
**B)** Provide detailed statistics about survival rates  
**C)** Acknowledge the devastating diagnosis and assess their understanding  
**D)** Refer directly to maternal-fetal medicine without counseling

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Acknowledge the devastating diagnosis and assess their understanding**

When delivering devastating news, first acknowledge the difficulty and assess what parents understand. This patient-centered approach allows for appropriate pacing of information delivery and addresses emotional needs before discussing options. Jumping to management or statistics without addressing emotions is inappropriate.

## Variant Interpretation

### Question 11.1
A variant in BRCA1 is identified with the following evidence: absent from population databases, multiple computational tools predict deleterious effect, located in functional domain, but no functional studies exist. Using ACMG criteria, this variant is MOST likely classified as:

**A)** Pathogenic  
**B)** Likely pathogenic  
**C)** Variant of uncertain significance  
**D)** Likely benign

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Variant of uncertain significance**

Using ACMG criteria: PM2 (absent from populations), PP3 (computational evidence), PM1 (functional domain). These criteria alone are insufficient for likely pathogenic classification, which requires stronger evidence. This represents a VUS, highlighting the importance of understanding classification criteria for proper patient counseling.
</details>

### Question 11.2
A laboratory reports a "variant of uncertain significance" in MLH1. The patient asks what this means for their cancer risk. The MOST accurate counseling is:

**A)** "This definitely increases your cancer risk"  
**B)** "This has no impact on your cancer risk"  
**C)** "We cannot use this result for medical management currently"  
**D)** "You should get prophylactic surgery to be safe"

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) "We cannot use this result for medical management currently"**

VUS results cannot be used for clinical decision-making. Management should be based on personal/family history. It's crucial to explain that VUS may be reclassified over time and to check periodically for updates. Neither reassurance nor intervention based solely on VUS is appropriate.

## Psychosocial Counseling

### Question 12.1
A woman undergoing prenatal diagnosis for Huntington disease (partner is affected) states: "If it's positive, I'm keeping the baby anyway - I just need to prepare myself." The genetic counselor should:

**A)** Question why she wants testing if she won't act on results  
**B)** Refuse testing since she won't terminate  
**C)** Explore her concepts of "preparation" and support her decision  
**D)** Require psychological evaluation before proceeding

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Explore her concepts of "preparation" and support her decision**

Genetic testing isn't only for pregnancy termination decisions. Many patients use information for emotional preparation, care planning, and family adjustment. The counselor should explore what "preparation" means to her and support autonomous decision-making while ensuring informed consent.
</details>

### Question 12.2
During counseling for carrier screening, a couple reveals they are first cousins. The woman appears uncomfortable while her husband insists "it's normal in our culture." The counselor should:

**A)** Calculate risks and avoid cultural discussions  
**B)** Educate them that cousin marriage is genetically inadvisable  
**C)** Acknowledge cultural differences while providing accurate risk information  
**D)** Refer to another counselor from their cultural background

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Acknowledge cultural differences while providing accurate risk information**

Cultural competence requires acknowledging different cultural practices without judgment while providing accurate genetic information. The counselor should present empiric risks (additional 2-3% risk above population baseline) neutrally and explore both partners' understanding and concerns individually if needed.
</details>

## Professional Practice

### Question 13.1
A genetic counselor in private practice is asked by a patient to provide a letter supporting their disability claim based on carrier status for sickle cell trait. The counselor should:

**A)** Write the letter as requested to support the patient  
**B)** Explain that carrier status alone doesn't constitute disability  
**C)** Refer to a physician for disability documentation  
**D)** Report the patient for insurance fraud

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Explain that carrier status alone doesn't constitute disability**

Genetic counselors must provide accurate information within their scope of practice. Sickle cell trait (carrier status) is generally asymptomatic and doesn't constitute disability. The counselor should educate about carrier status while maintaining professional boundaries and accurate documentation.
</details>

### Question 13.2
A genetic counselor notices their clinic has been billing insurance for "genetic testing counseling" when only discussing family history. They should:

**A)** Continue as instructed by their supervisor  
**B)** Anonymously report to insurance companies  
**C)** Address concerns through appropriate institutional channels  
**D)** Immediately quit to avoid liability

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Address concerns through appropriate institutional channels**

Professional integrity requires addressing billing concerns through proper channels - first with supervisors, then compliance office if needed. This maintains professional standards while following institutional procedures. Document concerns appropriately and seek guidance from professional organizations if needed.

## Reproductive Technologies

### Question 14.1
A couple pursuing IVF requests PGT-M for BRCA1 mutation and wants to select only male embryos to "prevent breast cancer." The counselor should explain:

**A)** This is acceptable since males have lower breast cancer risk  
**B)** Sex selection for medical reasons is always permitted  
**C)** Males with BRCA1 mutations still have increased cancer risks  
**D)** PGT-M cannot determine sex

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Males with BRCA1 mutations still have increased cancer risks**

While males with BRCA1 have lower breast cancer risk than females, they still have elevated risks for breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Sex selection for non-medical reasons raises ethical concerns. Accurate counseling about risks in both sexes is essential for informed decision-making.
</details>

### Question 14.2
A couple wants PGT-A (aneuploidy screening) for their IVF cycle. The woman is 28 with no history of pregnancy loss. Appropriate counseling includes:

**A)** PGT-A will definitely improve their pregnancy success rate  
**B)** PGT-A has uncertain benefit in good prognosis patients  
**C)** PGT-A is required for all IVF cycles  
**D)** PGT-A eliminates miscarriage risk

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) PGT-A has uncertain benefit in good prognosis patients**

Current evidence shows PGT-A's benefit is unclear in good prognosis patients (young age, no recurrent loss). It may reduce miscarriage rate but doesn't clearly improve live birth rate. Counseling should include limitations, mosaicism issues, and potential for discarding viable embryos.
</details>

## Risk Communication

### Question 15.1
When explaining a 1 in 4 (25%) recurrence risk for an autosomal recessive condition, which framing is MOST effective for patient understanding?

**A)** "There's a 75% chance your next child will be unaffected"  
**B)** "If you have 4 children, one will definitely be affected"  
**C)** "Each pregnancy has a 1 in 4 chance, like flipping two coins and getting two tails"  
**D)** "The risk is quite high, so you should consider not having more children"

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) "Each pregnancy has a 1 in 4 chance, like flipping two coins and getting two tails"**

Effective risk communication uses multiple frames and analogies. The coin flip analogy helps convey independent risk per pregnancy. Avoid directive counseling (option D) or misrepresenting cumulative risk (option B). While positive framing (option A) can be helpful, it should be balanced with clear risk explanation.

## Emerging Technologies

### Question 16.1
A patient asks about "liquid biopsy" testing advertised online for early cancer detection. Appropriate counseling includes:

**A)** These tests are FDA-approved for screening all cancer types  
**B)** Current tests have limitations including false positives and unclear management  
**C)** These tests replace need for standard cancer screening  
**D)** Only genetic counselors can order these tests

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Current tests have limitations including false positives and unclear management**

Multi-cancer early detection tests using cfDNA have significant limitations: high false positive rates, missed cancers, and no clear guidelines for managing positive results. Patients need counseling about these limitations and shouldn't abandon proven screening methods.
</details>

### Question 16.2
A patient with type 2 diabetes asks about polygenic risk scores (PRS) for their children. The counselor should explain:

**A)** PRS can definitively predict who will develop diabetes  
**B)** PRS for complex diseases have limited clinical utility currently  
**C)** PRS testing is diagnostic for diabetes risk  
**D)** PRS replaces need for lifestyle modifications

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) PRS for complex diseases have limited clinical utility currently**

While PRS research is advancing, clinical utility for complex diseases remains limited. PRS doesn't account for environmental factors, has population-specific limitations, and modest predictive power. Standard prevention strategies (lifestyle modification) remain more important than genetic risk scores.
