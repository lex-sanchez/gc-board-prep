## 📊 Overview of Chromosomal Abnormalities

### Types of Chromosomal Abnormalities

**Numerical Abnormalities:**
- **Aneuploidy**: Abnormal number of chromosomes
  - Monosomy (missing one chromosome)
  - Trisomy (extra chromosome)
  - Nullisomy, disomy in triploidy

**Structural Abnormalities:**
- **Deletions**: Loss of chromosomal material
- **Duplications**: Extra chromosomal material
- **Translocations**: Exchange between chromosomes
- **Inversions**: Reversed chromosomal segment

### Key Mechanisms
- **Nondisjunction**: Failure of chromosomes to separate properly
- **Maternal age effect**: Increased risk with advanced maternal age
- **Mosaicism**: Two or more cell lines with different karyotypes

## 🎯 Practice Questions

### Question 1
A 25-year-old pregnant woman has a fetus with the following ultrasound findings: choroid plexus cysts, clenched fists, and IUGR. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**A)** Trisomy 13  
**B)** Trisomy 18  
**C)** Trisomy 21  
**D)** Turner syndrome

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Trisomy 18**

The classic triad of choroid plexus cysts, clenched fists, and IUGR is pathognomonic for trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome). These findings together have high specificity for this condition.
</details>

### Question 2
Which serum screening pattern is most consistent with Down syndrome?

**A)** ↑hCG, ↓PAPP-A, ↓AFP, ↓uE3  
**B)** ↓hCG, ↓PAPP-A, ↓AFP, ↓uE3  
**C)** ↑hCG, ↑inhibin, ↓PAPP-A, ↓AFP, ↓uE3  
**D)** ↓hCG, ↑inhibin, ↑PAPP-A, ↑AFP

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: C) ↑hCG, ↑inhibin, ↓PAPP-A, ↓AFP, ↓uE3**

Down syndrome shows elevated hCG and inhibin A, with decreased levels of PAPP-A, AFP, and uE3. This pattern is distinct from trisomies 18 and 13, which show decreased levels across all markers.
</details>

### Question 3
A newborn presents with hypocalcemia, conotruncal heart defect, and absent thymus on chest X-ray. What is the most appropriate next step?

**A)** Karyotype  
**B)** Chromosomal microarray  
**C)** FISH for 22q11.2  
**D)** Fragile X testing

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**Answer: B) Chromosomal microarray**

The clinical presentation suggests 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. While FISH was historically used, CMA is now preferred as it can detect nested deletions and provides more comprehensive analysis of copy number variants.
