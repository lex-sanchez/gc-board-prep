## üìã HIGH-YIELD BOARD FACTS

### Population Screening Programs
1. **Hemoglobinopathies**:
   - Universal NBS in US
   - Targeted carrier screening by ethnicity
   - MCV <80 triggers evaluation

2. **CAH**:
   - All states screen
   - 17-OHP primary marker
   - High false positive in premature infants

3. **Ashkenazi Jewish Panel**:
   - Includes: Tay-Sachs, Gaucher, Bloom syndrome
   - Carrier rate: 1:4 for any disorder
   - Consider expanded panels

### Prenatal Diagnosis Challenges
1. **Skeletal dysplasias**:
   - Often not apparent until 3rd trimester
   - Molecular testing if known mutation
   - 3D ultrasound helpful

2. **OI Type II**:
   - Fractures visible on ultrasound
   - Decreased skull mineralization
   - Poor prognosis

### Cultural Considerations
1. **Deaf community**:
   - May not view deafness as disability
   - Respect communication preferences
   - Include deaf genetic counselors

2. **Albinism in Africa**:
   - Significant stigma/discrimination
   - Safety concerns
   - Cultural myths need addressing

### X-linked Counseling
1. **Carrier manifestations**:
   - Skewed X-inactivation
   - Variable expression
   - Important for medical management

2. **Reproductive options**:
   - PGT increasingly used
   - Sex selection controversial
   - Discuss all options neutrally

### Quality of Life Considerations
1. **Chronic conditions**:
   - Pain management crucial
   - Transition to adult care
   - Psychosocial support

2. **Visible differences**:
   - School accommodations
   - Bullying prevention
   - Support groups

## üßÆ PRACTICE QUESTIONS

### Question 1
A couple of Mediterranean ancestry requests carrier screening. The woman's CBC shows: Hgb 11.5 g/dL, MCV 72 fL. The man's CBC is normal. What is the most appropriate next step?

A) Reassure that only one partner needs testing
B) Order hemoglobin electrophoresis on the woman
C) Order molecular testing for Œ≤-thalassemia
D) Recommend prenatal diagnosis

**Answer: B**
- Low MCV suggests possible thalassemia trait
- Hemoglobin electrophoresis can identify Œ≤-thalassemia trait (elevated Hb A2)
- Partner testing depends on woman's results

### Question 2
A pregnant woman is a carrier for hemophilia A. Her partner is unaffected. CVS shows a 46,XY karyotype. What is the risk the fetus is affected?

A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

**Answer: C**
- X-linked recessive inheritance
- Male fetus has 50% chance of inheriting mutation
- Would be affected if inherits mutation

### Question 3
Parents of a child with osteogenesis imperfecta type II (perinatal lethal) request recurrence risk counseling. Neither parent is affected. What is the most likely recurrence risk?

A) <1%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 67%

**Answer: A**
- OI type II usually due to de novo dominant mutations
- Small risk due to gonadal mosaicism
- Prenatal diagnosis recommended for reassurance

### Question 4
A 6-month-old boy presents with blistering along linear patterns on his trunk. His mother had similar lesions as an infant that resolved. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Epidermolysis bullosa
B) Incontinentia pigmenti
C) Bloom syndrome
D) Xeroderma pigmentosum

**Answer: B**
- Linear blistering following Blaschko lines
- X-linked dominant with male lethality
- Mother likely has mild manifestations due to X-inactivation

### Question 5
A couple requests genetic counseling after their daughter was diagnosed with congenital profound hearing loss. Testing reveals she is homozygous for GJB2 mutations. What is the chance their next child will have hearing loss?

A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

**Answer: B**
- Autosomal recessive inheritance
- Both parents are carriers
- 25% recurrence risk
